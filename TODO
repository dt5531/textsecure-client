how to solve whitespace in the textbox vs the buffer with the arrow keys?
    Idea: keep a placeholder value in the buffer that you increment/decrement for left/right
    up + down increments by the length of the input screen (can we find that? window.maxYX function)
more contacts than fit on the screen 
    pad instead of window
delete doesn't wrap around right
    debug this shit
maybe hunt down what was causing that segfault and offer a patch?
    disable the initialization, the session was null because we didn't initalize.
    store.go line 315 segfaults because session is null
