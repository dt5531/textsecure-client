figure out how to use sqlite
encrypt incomin messages and put them in the database for the associated person
encrypt outgoing messages and put them in the database for the associated person





HIGH PRIORITY:

    With shittons of contacts, the thing doesn't scroll, even though it was supposed to.

    Still getting segfaults with Delete key

    concurrrency locks on drawing to the screen

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    UTF-8 passwords

    how to solve whitespace in the textbox vs the buffer with the arrow keys?
        Idea: keep a placeholder value in the buffer that you increment/decrement for left/right
        up + down increments by the length of the input screen (can we find that? window.maxYX function)

    delete doesn't wrap around right
        debug this shit

    
    Find out why there's occasional runtime errors in the ts library
        Partially figured out, need to write a bug report and file upstream


LOW PRIORITY:

    Idea: Make a confirmation icon to ensure that the message has been sent
    
    Handle Read reciepts

    add attachment dialog

    Make an AddressBook frontEnd for .config/contacts.yml for the nooblets

    maybe hunt down what was causing that segfault and offer a patch?
        disable the initialization, the session was null because we didn't initalize.
        store.go line 315 segfaults because session is null 
        Already filed a "bug" upstream
        write an automated test for this?
    
    Ask janimo to consider exposing session.go:359 - if he log.Printfs it's gonna screw up the pretty TUI
            log.Printf("Identity of remote %s is not trusted, it may have reinstalled\n. For now delete the file .storage/identity/remote_%s to approve.\n", id, id)
