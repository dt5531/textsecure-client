how to solve whitespace in the textbox vs the buffer with the arrow keys?
    Idea: keep a placeholder value in the buffer that you increment/decrement for left/right
    up + down increments by the length of the input screen (can we find that? window.maxYX function)
delete doesn't wrap around right
    debug this shit
maybe hunt down what was causing that segfault and offer a patch?
    disable the initialization, the session was null because we didn't initalize.
    store.go line 315 segfaults because session is null 
    Already filed a "bug" upstream
    write an automated test for this?
Make an AddressBook frontEnd for .config/contacts.yml
Make mapping "g" to go to top of contacts list "G" to go to bottom of contacts list
