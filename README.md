** At the moment nothing is supported, this is still in development and DOES.NOT.WORK **

Installation
------------

    go get github.com/f4lk0r/textsecure-client

For more details, including setting up Go, check out janimo's [wiki] (https://github.com/janimo/textsecure/wiki/Installation)

Configuration
-------------

Copy .config to a directory and modify it, then run the tool from that directory.
It will create .storage to hold all the protocol state. Removing that dir and running
the tool again will trigger a reregistration with the server.
