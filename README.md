# TextSecure Command Line Client

Many thanks to the people behind golang, ncurses, Rob Thornton for his [goncurses] (https://code.google.com/p/goncurses/) library, and @janimo for his [golang textsecure] (https://github.com/janimo/textsecure.git) library.

** At the moment nothing is supported, this is still in development and DOES.NOT.WORK **

Installation
------------

    go get github.com/f4lk0r/textsecure-client

For more details, including setting up Go, check out janimo's [wiki] (https://github.com/janimo/textsecure/wiki/Installation)

Configuration
-------------

This cannot be configured YET. The best you can do is configure in janimo's cmd/textsecure folder and then copy and paste the .storage and .config directories over to this folder.

Usage
-----

This doesn't work yet, there is no usage
